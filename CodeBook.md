# CodeBook for Tidy Data

### The said codebook is with reference to the tidy data created as part of run_analysis.R

It contains 181 observations of 81 variables.

## Identifiers

 SubjectID - It refers to the ID assigned to a particular person who is a part of the experiment.
 
 Activity - The activity performed by the subject. The activity is mentioned in the descriptive form.

## Measurements 

### Corresponding to each subject there are 6 activities and each activity has its own set of measurements.

Here we will see the mean of the measurements which were taken over a few days. Here the measurements are a subset of the raw data containing only the mean and the standard deviations.

### The measurement Variables are as follows - 

tBodyAcc.mean...X            
tBodyAcc.mean...Y              
tBodyAcc.mean...Z
